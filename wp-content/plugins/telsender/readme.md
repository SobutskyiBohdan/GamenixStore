TelSender - a plugin that works with contact form 7 and the woocommerce store in wordprees. It sends applications from forms to a chat telegram. No proxy

== Description ==
Contact form 7 has earned fame as a free form designer with a flexible settings system.

I suggest that this only improve. Namely, send letters not only to mail, but also to chat telegrams.
It is also possible to send orders from your wooccommerce store. Example message in screenshot # 3.
